  <p class = "par">Arthur Meschian was born on March 3, 1949, in Yerevan, Armenia. Since childhood, Meschian has been <br/>
    interested in music and arts; singing songs in languages ranging from Hungarian to English. At the age of seven, he started <br/>
    taking violin and piano lessons at the school of music named after A. Spendiaryan. It was during those years when he <br/>
    made his first steps in writing songs and joined the boy’s chorus at the National Academic Theater for Opera and Ballet. <br/>
    In 1973, he briefly joined the chorus of the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin. Even though his stay was short (less than a year) <br/>
    in the chorus, it had a profound influence on his subsequent musical creations. While still at school, Meschian wrote <br/>
    some of his early masterpieces including “Where were you, God?” “The Will,” and “The Old Man.” <hr class = "line" />

    In 1965, he first performed his well acclaimed and widely controversial “Where were you, God?” in the auditorium of <br/>
    number 122 secondary school where he was a student at the time. In 1966, he got accepted to the department of architecture <br/>
    at the National Polytechnic University of Armenia. In 1967, Meschian, along with his friends Levon Melikian and <br/>
    Gregory Nalbandian, founded a rock band which they initially did not give a name. The band was simply referred to as <br/>
    “The Band of the Department of Architecture.” After giving a series of concerts throughout 1967 and on, the band gained <br/>
    an immense deal of acclaim among the youth. By blending Armenian spiritual music with the thriving rock of the time, <br/>
    the band left a remarkable impression on its listeners and became a true revelation. As a result, the activists at <br/>
    the Communist Committee raised concerns about the band’s prolific endeavors. The committee led an anti-Meschian campaign <br/>
    accusing him of anti-Soviet propaganda and calling the band members “Newly Ordained Apostles.” It was, in many parts, <br/>
    due to the name calling, that the band was later named “The apostles.” The remarkable success of the Apostles was not <br/>
    hindered by anti-Meschian Communist efforts. <hr class = "line" />

    In the early 1970s, Meschian composed the first Armenian rock opera, “The Insane Asylum” which vastly contributed to <br/>
    the band’s publicity. Thereafter, the band started giving concerts in numerous universities and cities such as Gyumri, <br/>
    Moscow, Yerevan, and Tallinn. In 1971, Meschian gave an outstanding performance in the USSR festival for young musicians <br/>
    in Poland, where the band was only allowed to participate under the guidance of the Communist Committee Activists. <br/>
    Despite the fact that the Apostles found themselves performing in various republics throughout the Soviet Union, <br/>
    they always remained loyal to performing in their native Armenian. In 1972, Meschian successfully graduated from university,<br/>
    but due to the anti-Meschian attitudes infested in the Armenian Soviet Republic, it took him two years to find a job <br/>
    as an architect. In 1974, Meschian was employed by the Armenian Governmental Project where he participated in the <br/>
    development of Zvartnots Airport in Yerevan. In 1973, he briefly joined the chorus of the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin,<br/>
    where he made the acquaintance of his Holiness Vazgen I, the Catholicos of the Armenian Apostolic Church who commissioned <br/>
    him to write a requiem dedicated to the martyrs of the Armenian Genocide. With Moushegh Ishkhan’s permission, Meschian <br/>
    used some of his verses in writing the requiem. In 1975, Meschian performed his requiem at the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin, <br/>
    and with the support of the Catholicos, he later recorded the masterpiece. <hr class = "line"/>

    At the beginning of the next decade, the Apostles, unexpectedly, disappeared from the musical arena. At the time of <br/>
    its existence, the band featured various musicians such as Ashot Adamyan, Gevorg Mangasaryan, Viguen Stepanyan, <br/>
    Gevorg Jangulyan, Movses Muradyan, Ashot Eghikyan, Stanislav Buniatyan, Rostom Ohanyan, and Ashot Eghikyan. In 1984,<br/>
    Meschian started his own musical path with his students, Vahan Artsruni and Gourgen Melikyan. In the 1980s, he also <br/>
    got leading roles in two motion pictures. He became a part of the film, The Glowing Fire of the Night, playing the <br/>
    role of Michael Nalbandian. That was an opportunity for him to have his songs included in the movie. The film gave him<br/>
    the basis to do a professional recording in the Melodia Studio of Moscow. The film highlighted three of Meschian’s works,<br/>
    “Ancient Land,” “Epitaph” and “Resurrection.” The second film he did was “And, Everything will Recur,” which came out <br/>
    in 1989 when Meschian had already moved to the United States. In the early 1980s, Meschian was the leader of the Armenian<br/>
    Industrial Project Studio of Architecture. At the time, he had supervised the reconstruction of Lazarian Seminary in <br/>
    Moscow (Later the Embassy of the Armenian Republic). He also laid out the construction of the building of Admission for<br/>
    the Armenian government in Yerevan, the extension building to Matenadaran, the library of Manuscripts whose construction<br/>
    got delayed due to the 1988 earthquake and only resumed in 2007, when Meschain was back in Yerevan. In 1989, Meschian, <br/>
    along with his family, moved to Boston, where he finally managed to properly record his songs <br>

    In 1990 he started performing in places such as the Armenian Church of Boston, the center of Armenian Relief Fund <br/>
    and The Wilshire Ebell Theatre. In 1990, he recorded his first album called Catharsis. In addition, he formed a new <br/>
    band called Apostles 90 with Wayne Johnson on the guitar, John Leftwich on the bass and Art Rodrigues on the drums. <br/>
    In 1993, Meschian released yet another album called The Monologue of the Insane Violinist and gave a series of concerts<br/>
    with Apostles 90 in Pasadena, CA. In 1995, Meschian released two other albums; Wander, which included a couple of songs<br/>
    from the Requiem and Communion which he deems the pinnacle of his musical career. In 1996 He first performed the <br/>
    Communion at the First Church of Nazarene in Pasadena. Later in the same year, his Communion was performed four days<br/>
    in a row at the National Academic Theater for Opera and Ballet in Yerevan. <hr class="line">

  <p class="par">
    In 2001, Meschian released his hit collection featuring four CDs encompassing “The monologue of a Crazy Violinist,” <br/>
    “Catharsis”, “Catharsis 2”, and “Communion.” In 2003, he gave a concert at the Kodak Theater (now Dolby Theatre ), <br/>
    where he presented his new songs and performed the Sayat Nova piece. In 2005, after living in the United States for <br/>
    17 years, Meschian and his wife returned to Armenia. There, he gave a series of concerts which were highly esteemed <br/>
    and appreciated by both the general public and his long term fans who had been loyal to his art since the Soviet times. <br/>
    In 2007, the construction of the new section of the Mesrop Mashtots Institute of Ancient Manuscripts begins under the<br/>
    guidance of the chief architect Arthur Meschian. Meschian worked very hard to finish the project before schedule in 2011. <br/>
    Notwithstanding his busy schedule, Meschian managed to give yet another concert tour in 2009. He performed in Yerevan, <br/>
    Moscow, and Pasadena LA. In 2015, architect Meschian finishes yet another project. This time, he designs and conceives <br/>
    the first newly-built museum of Komitas in Yerevan, Armenia <br/>
    In 2011, Arthur Meschian is awarded the Mesrop Mashtots Medal. In 2012, Meschian is awarded the golden medal of the <br/>
    office of public construction in Yerevan, Armenia. In 2013, he is awarded the national accolade of the Armenian Republic<br/>
    for his Matenataran project. As of now, despite his huge musical success, Meschian is not in a hurry to present his new musical creations.
